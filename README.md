Welcome! 

This is the code repository for @Luonnontila (www.luonnontila.fi), a web service distributing information about the state of Finnish nature via biodiversity related indicators. Luonnontila is a collaborative effort between all major Finnish data providers and institutions working with biodiversity associated data (Finnish Museum of Natural History, Natural Resources Institue Finland, MetsÃ¤hallitus and Finnish Environment Institute). Luonnontila is currently coordinated at the Finnish Environment Institute (Syke, www.syke.fi). In this repository we aim to distribute codes for the indicators presented at the web service, particularly those produced at the Finnish Environment Institute.

Take note, that Luonnontila is in a constant state of development and we welcome any improvements to our indicators from both experts and general public.

ðŸ“« Luonnontila is currently operated by Aapo Kahilainen, PÃ¤ivi SirkiÃ¤ and Ari-Pekka Auvinen of The Finnish Environment Institute. We can be contacted via email [firstname.surname(a)syke.fi].
